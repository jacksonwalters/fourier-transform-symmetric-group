# non-abelian-fourier-transform
Computes the Fourier transform of functions on the symmetric group.

Attempts to compute the dim D^{\lambda}, the dimensions of the simple modules for the modular representations of the symmetric group by computing the rank of the Gram matrix $(\langle e_i,e_j\rangle)_{i,j=1,...,n}$.
