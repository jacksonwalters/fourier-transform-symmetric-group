# non-abelian-fourier-transform
Computes the Fourier transform of functions on the symmetric group.

Attempts to compute the dim D^{\lambda}, the dimensions of the simple modules for the modular representations of the symmetric group by computing the rank of the Gram matrix $(<e_i,e_j>)_{i,j=1,...,n}$.
